 *  - `comm.controlState` — 0 no control, 1 partial, 2 full.
 *
 * Until Telemachus reports `comm.connected` (warmup, or no vessel active)
 * we stay in the "connected" state so the banner stays hidden — the banner
 * is for genuine blackouts, not absence of data.
 *
 * Elapsed time is measured from the moment the state last left "connected".
 * A 1s interval ticks a render to keep the timer label fresh.
